# Unity Interface Support
This tiny Unity package allows for a user to quickly and easily add interface support to the Unity inspector.

In modern programming, proper dependency injection is essential for scaling up a project. Sadly, Unity's serializer does not currently allow for an easy implementation of interface-based components. This plugin adds a quick-and-simple approach to allowing an interface to be used within your MonoBehavior safe to assign from the editor without any fears of serialization getting in the way, or adding components of the wrong type.

### Downloading
A download link to the compiled Unity package can be found in the Actions tab. Then simply select the lastest build "CI".
